# RAG-System-Using-FAISS-Database
In this project I have created a RAG system using FAISS database which refers to a text file. This text file has the data/info for RAG. This entire data has been splitted into smaller chunk with size 500,these chunks are converted into embeddings and stored into vectore database that is FAISS in this case.
