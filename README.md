# RAG-System-Using-FAISS-Database
In this project I have created a RAG system using FAISS database which refers to a text file. This text file has the data/info for RAG. This entire data has been splitted into smaller chunk with size 500,these chunks are converted into embeddings using openAI embeddings and stored into vectore database that is FAISS in this case. NOw when user asks any question to RAG it will first converted into embeddings and then by similarity searc RAG will search for the related data in the vectore database(FAISS) once the releted information is found it is sent back to the user as a response.
